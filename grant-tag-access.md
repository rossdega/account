# Granting users access to tag resources
{: #access}

As the account owner, you might want to delegate some of the responsibility of tagging resources. For users to add tags to a resource, you must grant them the appropriate access. Use {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}} Identity and Access Management (IAM) access policies to grant users access to resources in a resource group. Use Cloud Foundry roles to grant users access to resources in a Cloud Foundry org and space.

## Tagging permissions
{: #tagging-permissions}

Any user in an account can view tags. When a resource is tagged, all users who have read access to the resource can view the tag. To add or remove a tag from a resource, certain access roles or permissions are required depending on the resource type. See the following table to understand what role is required for each resource type.


| Resource Type | Role |
|--------|---------------|
| IAM-enabled | Editor or administrator on the resource |
| Cloud Foundry | Developer on the space that the resource belongs to  |
| Bare metal on classic infrastructure| View hardware details plus access to a specific set of services or All Bare Metal Servers |
| Dedicated Hosts on classic infrastructure | View virtual dedicated host details plus access to a specific set of services or All Dedicated Hosts |
| Virtual Server on classic infrastructure | View virtual server details plus access to a specific set of services or All Virtual Servers |
| Cloud Object Storage S3 on classic infrastructure | Storage manage permission |
| File Storage on classic infrastructure | Storage manage permission |
| Evault backup on classic infrastructure | Storage manage permission |
| Content Delivery Network on classic infrastructure | Manage CDN account permission |
| Direct Link on classic infrastructure | Account member |
| Hardware Firewall | Manage Firewalls |
| FortiGate Security Appliance | Manage Firewalls |
| IBM Cloud Load Balancer | Manage Load Balancers |
| Gateway Appliance | Manage Network Gateways |
